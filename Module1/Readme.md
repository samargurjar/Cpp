## [Hello.cpp](https://github.com/samargurjar/Cpp/blob/master/Module1/part2/hello.cpp)

#####  There are small fragments of POC in the code. 
- From line 3 there is POC for allocation of heap space in memory. 
- From line 34 there is POC for using private variable in the class.
- From line 67 there is POC for calling and returning value from the static function in the class.
- From line102 there is the POC for constructor concept.
- From line 141 there is POC for recursion of a function.
- From line 176 there is POC for pointers which changes the value of the orignal variable
- From line 199 It is an another instance for using and changing the valur of the orignal variable
- From line 223 there is POC for Pass by value, pass by address, pass by reference.
- From line 276 there is POC for reference concept.
- From line 293 there is POC for setting value to the private variable using class function.
